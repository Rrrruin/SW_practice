How often do you hear people say “I will be happy when …”such as “When I get that thing, I will be happy,” “I will be happy when I pass the exam” and “I would be happy if I had more money”. I have heard these things before and I am sure that I will hear them again.

Many people want to believe that finding happiness is all about finding or getting something that they want. However, not many people have ever found long-term happiness by achieving a goal. There will always be another thing that they want. There will always be another exam or another dollar.
